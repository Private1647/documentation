This documentation outlines the steps to create a test run for KaneAI generated tests using Test Manager. The steps include selecting test cases, setting configurations, and running tests with HyperExecute for efficient execution. Follow the instructions carefully to ensure seamless execution of the process.

## Prerequisites
- Access to Test Manager.
- A project with KaneAI-generated test cases.
- Credentials for LambdaTest platform.

## Step-by-Step Guide
### Step 1: Navigate to the Projects Page
- Log in to Test Manager. Navigate to the Projects page and select the desired project.
- Proceed to the Test Cases section.

### Step 2: Create a Test Run

### Step 4: Assign and Configure Test Cases
- On the test run page, review the added test cases.
- Assign team members in bulk.
- Update configurations as required.

#### Set Configurations
- Choose from available desktop browser and mobile app configurations. If a new configuration is needed, click on Create Configuration button and choose from thousands of configuration options.

    - **Manufacturer :** e.g., Samsung.
    - **Device :** e.g., Galaxy S24.
    - **OS Version :** e.g., 14.
    - **App :** e.g., Proverbial.
- Click on Create Configuration

### Step 5: Run with HyperExecute
- Initiate the run using HyperExecute by clicking **Run with HyperExecute**.
- View all test instances in the dashboard.
