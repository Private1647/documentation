- The scan will run immediately after configuration, regardless of the chosen recurring schedule.
- This is useful for verifying the setup and ensuring that the scan configuration works as intended.

## Step 6: Analyze the Scan Report
After selecting a scan, A detailed scan report will open, as shown in the provided screenshot. The report will display the following key components:
- **Total Issues :** A graph summarizing the trend of detected issues over the last few runs.
- **Severity Trend :** A chart categorizing issues by severity (e.g., Critical, Serious, Moderate, Minor).
- **Pages Scanned :** A list of scanned pages with their corresponding issue counts categorized by severity.

You can drill down into individual page URLs to view the number of issues found on that specific page using filters provided. From the scan report page, you can also edit, share and stop recurring scan if its no longer required.
