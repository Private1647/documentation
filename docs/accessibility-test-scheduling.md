Web Accessibility is crucial for creating inclusive digital experiences. This ensures that all the users, including those with disabilities, can access and interact with web content. However, manually verifying accessibility compliance is often time-intensive and prone to human error.

To address these challenges, LambdaTest introduces the Accessibility Schedulerâ€”an automated solution to help you stay compliant with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). This tool streamlines accessibility testing by automating checks and generating comprehensive reports, ensuring a faster, more reliable process.

The Scheduled Accessibility Scan feature allows you to automate recurring or one-time accessibility scans, significantly reducing manual effort while ensuring high standards of accessibility compliance.

## Key Features
- **Automated Scheduling :** Set up recurring or one-time scans for your websites.
- **WCAG Compliance :** Ensure your websites adhere to WCAG standards (selectable version).
- **Local and Authenticated Pages :** Configure scans for local environments and authenticated pages.
- **Comprehensive Reporting :** Receive detailed scan reports via email and access them on the dashboard.

## Use Case
- **Developers :** Stay ahead of accessibility issues by scheduling regular scans and ensuring WCAG compliance throughout the development lifecycle.
- **QA Testers :** Conduct detailed accessibility testing as part of their quality assurance workflows.
- **Product Managers :** Monitor accessibility performance across websites to meet organizational and legal compliance requirements.
