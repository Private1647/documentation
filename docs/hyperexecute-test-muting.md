# Test Muting

Imagine you are a software tester, and you have a test suite with hundreds of tests. Some of these tests are known to fail consistently, but there is no way to disable them. This means that every time you run the test suite, these failing tests cause the suite to fail. This can be frustrating and time-consuming, especially if you are trying to identify and resolve real problems with the application under test.

**Test Muting** is a feature that allows you to temporarily disable a test case from being executed. This can be useful for skipping failing or irrelevant tests, which can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your test runs and help you focus on the most important results.

## How do you Enable Test Muting for your Organization?

As you can see, we have triggered a Job in HyperExecute, and we've encountered a recurring issue with a specific test consistently failing. To address this, we will implement Test Muting functionality, enabling automatic muting of a test that fails a predefined consecutive number of times.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/features/test-muting/8.png').default} alt="Image" className="doc_img"/>

Now, to enable the Test Muting, follow the below mentioned steps:

<div className="storylane-iframe">
  <script async src="https://js.storylane.io/js/v2/storylane.js"></script>
  <div className="sl-embed">
    <iframe loading="lazy" className="sl-demo" src="https://app.storylane.io/demo/ctmmlcgefgxn?embed=inline" name="sl-embed" allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

**Step 1:** Go to the [LambdaTest Dashboard](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/dashboard).

**Step 2:** Click on the **Settings** button.

**Step 3:** Click to the **Organization Settings** section.

**Step 4:** Go to the **Org Product Preferences** section.

**Step 5:** Click on the "**Automatically mute tests**" toggle button.

- Select the threshold number to automatically mute your tests (default setting is 5 times).
- Customize your **Notification Settings** to mute specific tests and reduce distractions during test execution.
- You can also choose if you would like to receive updates on your mail id and click on **Save** button.

**Step 6:** Now, if you trigger the same job again, you will notice that the particular test has muted.

## How do you Manually Mute specific Tests?

<div className="storylane-iframe">
  <script async src="https://js.storylane.io/js/v2/storylane.js"></script>
  <div className="sl-embed">
    <iframe loading="lazy" className="sl-demo" src="https://app.storylane.io/demo/d9wfxwteumny?embed=inline" name="sl-embed" allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

**Step 1:** Execute your job on HyperExecute.

- Click on the **3 dots** of the desired test you want to **Mute**.
- Click on the **Mute Scenario** button.

**Step 2:** Trigger the same job again, and you will notice that particular test won't be executed.

## How do you UnMute Tests?

<div className="storylane-iframe">
  <script async src="https://js.storylane.io/js/v2/storylane.js"></script>
  <div className="sl-embed">
    <iframe loading="lazy" className="sl-demo" src="https://app.storylane.io/demo/m48g5owz95jz?embed=inline" name="sl-embed" allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

**Step 1:** Click on the **3 dots** of the muted test.

**Step 2:** Click on the **Unmute scenario** button. 


> The test will remain in-active until manually unmuted.
