This guide provides a detailed walkthrough for automating the execution of test runs using CI/CD tools such as GitHub Actions or Jenkins on the KaneAI platform. By following these steps, you can effortlessly integrate test run executions with your pipelines.

## Prerequisites
- Access to Test Manager.
- A project with KaneAI-generated test cases.
- Credentials for LambdaTest platform.

## Step-by-Step Guide
### Step 1: Navigate to the Test Manager
- Log in to the KaneAI platform and go to the Test Manager page.
- Access the project where the test run is located.

### Step 2: Locate the 'Test Runs' Section & Copy Test run ID
Inside your selected project, navigate to the Test Runs section. Select the desired test run for integration or direct triggering from your CI/CD pipeline.

Open the test run to view its URL. Copy the Test Run ID from the URL. This ID will be used in the API call for integration.

:::tip
A list of test instances with various configurations will be displayed for each test run.
:::

#### Example API Call:

```yaml
curl --location 'https://test-manager-api.lambdatest.com/api/atm/v1/hyperexecute' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic <Base64Auth>' \
--data '{
    "test_run_id": "YOUR_TEST_RUN_ID", #enter test run id
    "concurrency": 1, # Optional, Default 1
    "title": "UNIQUE_BUILD_NAME", #Optional
    "region": "YOUR_DESIRED_REGION" #eastus, centralindia
}'
```


#### Sample API Response:

The API response contains the job ID for both jobs created for desktop web tests as well as mobile tests on real devices. Here is a sample response for a test run which contains both app and web test cases:

```yaml
{
    "job_id": "abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd1234",
    "app_job_id": "abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd1234",
    "test_run_id": "01LAMBDATEST2024KANEAIJ8NPGDP",
    "job_link": "https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/task?jobId=<job_id>",
    "mobile_job_link": "https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/task?jobId=<app_job_id>"
}
```

### Step 3: Configure the API Call
Replace `<TestRunID>` with the actual ID from the URL and set additional optional parameters:

- **Concurrency :** Defaults to 1 if not specified.
- **Title :** Assign a unique job title; a random one will be generated if omitted.
- **Region :** Choose a region such as eastus or centralindia.

Confirm that the job title is unique to avoid conflicts. Select a region if you require a specific allocation for your devices.


### Step 4: Authenticate and Trigger the Job
- Provide your LambdaTest username and access key for Basic Authentication.
- Submit the API call to trigger the job. The process will start within seconds.

> **Important :** Keep your credentials secure to maintain platform integrity.


### Step 5: Monitor Test Executions
- Follow the link provided in the API response to view the HyperExecute Job.
- Monitor running executions in real time through the dashboard.

## GithubActions sample
Here is a sample that you can use on how to integrate the API with GithubActions in your Github repository:

**Step 1: Create a GitHub Actions Workflow YAML File**
In your Git repository, navigate to .github/workflows/ and create a file named sanity-test.yml.

**Step 2: Sample for yml file**
In below sample, we are executing a test run using test_run_id and then verifying the result for it using HyperExecute job status API. You can find more details on HyperExecute APIs [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/api-doc/?key=hyperexecute) and update the API in the .yml file based on your needs.

```yml
name: Run Sanity Tests on LambdaTest

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  sanity-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Trigger Sanity Test on LambdaTest
        id: trigger-test
        run: |
          echo "Triggering sanity tests on LambdaTest"
          response=$(curl --location 'https://test-manager-api.lambdatest.com/api/atm/v1/hyperexecute' \
            --header 'accept: application/json' \
            --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            --header 'Authorization: Basic <Base64Auth>' \
            --data '{
                "test_run_id" : "<test_run_id>",
                "concurrency" : 1,
            }')
          echo "Response: $response"
          job_id=$(echo $response | jq -r '.job_id')
          echo "Job ID: $job_id"
          echo "::set-output name=job_id::$job_id"
      
      - name: Check Test Status
        run: |
          echo "Checking test status"
          job_id=${{ steps.trigger-test.outputs.job_id }}
          sleep 240  # Wait before checking the status
          response=$(curl --location "https://api.hyperexecute.cloud/v2.0/job/$job_id" \
            --header "accept: application/json" \
            --header "Authorization: Basic <Base64Auth>")
            
          echo "Response: $response"
          status=$(echo $response | jq -r '.data.status')
          echo "Test status: $status"
          if [[ "$status" != "completed" ]]; then
            echo "Tests failed. Exiting with error."
            exit 1
          fi
          echo "Sanity tests passed successfully."
```

**Step 3: Define Workflow Triggers**
Set the workflow to trigger on push and pull_request events (you can modify the trigger based on your needs) under "on" section of the yaml above.
