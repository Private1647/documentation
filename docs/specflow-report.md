SpecFlow is a free tool for automating tests using BDD. It's often used to create automation scripts for .NET projects.
This technical document provides a guide on generating SpecFlow reports after executing tests on HyperExecute.

## Steps to Generate Cucumber Reports on HyperExecute

**Step 1:** Configure all the necessary dependencies and configurations to your project.

**Step 2:** Configure the report parameters in the HyperExecute YAML file.

```yaml
report: true
partialReports:
  location: YOUR_REPORTS_LOCATION
  type: html
  frameworkName: specflow
```

**Step 3:** Now execute your job by triggering the HyperExecute CLI. You can visit the HyperExecute dashboard to download the report after job completion.
